Dropbox for Retail - Flickity

Dropbox for Retail is my first real web development project. I interviewed people on the sales team, designed mockups and layouts, and coded the website based on my own specifications.

During my interview process with the sales team, I learned two things that I needed to highlight in my website:

1. Our landing pages need to be “verticalized”: In order for us to appeal to larger customers, we need to make our product appear to be more customized and specific to their industry. Even if we do not change our product, we need to ways to frame our product strengths in ways that the customer can understand. The reason why I picked the retail industry is that we have an incredibly strong use case and a great set of customers, such as Under Armour, VitaCoco, BCBG, etc. 
2. Our webpages need to focus more on our customers: Customer references is consistently ranked as one of the most important factors to a buyer. Furthermore, Dropbox is being leveraged by some of the world’s most innovative and creative companies.

After my interviews, I designed mock ups and went through a few iterations with the sales team at Dropbox. My biggest technical learning was implementing the carousel. I have two versions of this project, one with Flickity and one with a custom built carousel. Flickity provides a really easy way to create touch and responsive carousel and I wanted to leverage their technology. In addition, I also wanted to learn how to create a carousel so I created a custom implementation with an auto-timer.
